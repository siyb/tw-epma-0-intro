## This is how you get your grade

* At the end of the course (last session), there will be a short exam taking 45 minutes
    * Written exam
    * 3 Questions, each of which is worth 5 points
    * Total of 15 Points
* If you are diligently doing the in session exercises, you will not have an issue answering those questions ;)

## Process

* Each session consists of a theoretical and a practical component
    * The theoretical part is your standard lecture ...
    * ... while the practical part requires you to solve a problem
    * -> coding!
* It's up to you to complete the programming task at home

## Outlook

* Session 1:
    * We are going to learn about Android Testing
    * UI Testing, since I assume that every one of you has had some experience with Unit testing in the past
    * No integration testing, that's something we will cover in session 3
    * Required: Android Studio, Genymotion (or Android Emulator)

* Session 2:
    * We will be playing around with Android's build system
    * Required: Android Studio, Genymotion (or Android Emulator)

* Session 3:
    * Mobile API Design
        * Dos and Don'ts
